Dr. Itzhak Katra is a young and energetic member of the Dept. of Geography and Environmental Development.  

Dr. Katra's research expertise includes:  
The Interrelationships between Environment and Health Remote Sensing (Thermal Infrared) for Environment and Health Eco-Geomorphology in Arid Areas Desert Dust: Source Areas, Storms, Emissions, and General Dynamics Dr. Katra has been an invited expert speaker at the General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union (EGU).  

Recently, Dr. Katra (along with the other BGU researchers mentioned above) was awarded a competitive research grant from the Environment and Health Fund (EHF) of Israel.  Funding was received for a project entitled, "Soils as a Source of Atmospheric Particles: a Spatio-Temporal Impact on Air-Quality and Human Health in the Negev."  This project will investigate the relationship between soil-derived airborne particles (SDAP), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and Chronic Ischemic Heart Diseases (CIHD).  The project will culminate with a new data-set assimilating spatio-temporal data in order to enable the identification of exposure and risk patterns between SDAP exposure and a variety of clinical conditions.
