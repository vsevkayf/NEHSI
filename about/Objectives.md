**Our
goals**

With
the foundation of Institute, we will use our knowledge and expertise
on the impact of environmental hazards on the health and wellbeing of
people and ecosystems by
establishing a grid of a comprehensive environmental monitoring
stations platform. We will reach out to the community by developing a
comprehensive program of environmental education in schools, and by
the dissemination of exposure and research information to the Negev
population via an accessible online website.  We will create a
synergistic collaboration with the policy makers, education
facilities, IDF and municipalities. Most importantly, keeping in mind
the recent major regional changes, we will strengthen the community
awareness to the environment and facilitate creative patterns of
health promotion activities via youth organizations and elderly
clubs.

**Specifically,
we will:**

- Develop
	a comprehensive, robust and validated approach to environmental
	exposure assessment for the Negev Area (i.e. solar radiation, heat
	burden, air pollution).   
- Promote
	_teaching
	and training_
	in the field of environmental health, particularly via students in
	primary and high schools in the Negev Area. Educational programs
	will develop environmental literacy among students, promote
	environmental knowledge and skills, aim to change their attitudes
	and behaviors. The students will be trained to become environmental
	stewards and influence the entire community. 
- Promote
	the development of the specific focused programs at the neighborhood
	level, that will help to extend  _Green
	Spaces_
	(by planting trees, parks) and reduce motor transport in the
	residential neighborhoods) to create micro-climate that will reduce
	the negative impact of the dust, emissions, as well as, other 
	adverse effects of urbanization. 
- Serve
	as a catalyst for dialogue and improved _communication
	& coordination_
	between relevant stakeholders in Israel.  This in order to ensure a
	healthier future for the Negev residents based on _more
	highly integrated systems_,
	resulting in _greater
	effectiveness _vis-à-vis
	the identification and remediation of environmental health risks. 
- Initiate
	local intervention projects aimed to strengthen the Negev community,
	promote health and wellbeing by introducing health education
	programs. 
- Insure
	sustainability by integrating follow-up programs into the ongoing
	intervention projects.
